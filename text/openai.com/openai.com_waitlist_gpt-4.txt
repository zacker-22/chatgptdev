Updated over a week agoTable of contentsAPI AccessOn July 6, 2023, we gave access to the GPT-4 API (8k) to all API users who have made a successful payment of $1 or more. We plan to open up access to all developers soon, and then start raising rate-limits after that depending on compute availability. We are not currently granting access to GPT-4-32K API, but it will be made available at a later date. For API accounts created after August 18, 2023, you can get instant access to GPT-4 after purchasing $0.50 worth or more of pre-paid credits. You can read about prepaid billing here. ChatGPT PlusChatGPT Plus subscribers will get GPT-4 access on chat.openai.com with a usage cap. We will dynamically adjust the exact usage cap depending on demand and system performance in practice. GPT-4 currently has a cap of 50 messages every 3 hours. Please be patient though — we expect massive demand and will scale up and optimize our systems over the coming months. Note: this will not provide subscribers with access to the API.Related ArticlesHow much does GPT-4 cost?What is the difference between the GPT-4 models?What are the GPT-4 rate limits?How can I use GPT-4 in ChatGPT?What is ChatGPT Enterprise?Did this answer your question?😞😐😃ChatGPTAPIDALL·EService Status
